# iNaturalist_Competition

Script to classify images of plants and animals with the image-based species recognition models created in the context of the paper by [Van Horn et al. 2021](http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/2103.16483), benchmarking different kinds of models created on basis of the dataset of the [iNaturalist 2021 Comptetition](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_comp/tree/master/2021). The code was extracted from this [repository](https://github.com/deblagoj/iNaturalist-API) by [deblagoj](https://github.com/deblagoj) as a contribution to the iNaturalist 2017 Competition.

## How-To

1. (recommended but not absolutely necessary) create and activate own (conda) environment 

2. install packages 
```
pip install torch torchvision 
```

  2.1 Actually this should work, otherwise you can also use the provided conda environment file `environment.yml`. 
  Run in the repository:
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate inat_2021
  ```

3. Clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/EibSReM/iNaturalist_Competition.git
``` 
and change to respective directory

4. Download pretrained models from the paper [here](https://cornell.box.com/s/bnyhq5lwobu6fgjrub44zle0pyjijbmw) (5,6 GB), mentioned in the [papers repository](https://github.com/visipedia/newt/tree/main/benchmark).

5. Unzip file with pretrained models (probably needs to be unzipped twice: first time the .tar.gz file, sedondly the .tar file in the unzipped folder from the previous step)

6. Adapt path to pytorch model in the `inference.py` script (we used the model in: cvpr21_newt_pretrained_models\cvpr21_newt_pretrained_models\pt\inat2021_supervised_large_from_scratch.pth.tar)

7. Adapt path to images (folder) in the `inference.py` script

8. Run script 
```
python inference.py
```

9. Find results in `Output.txt`

## Runtime
Classifying 258 images, the script run 81.02 seconds on a Windows 10 notebook with the following hardware specifications:
* Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz   1.99 GHz
* 20 GB Ram
