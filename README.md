# iNaturalist_Competition

Script to classify images of plants and animals with the image-based species recognition models created in the context of the paper by [Van Horn et al. 2021](http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/2103.16483), benchmarking different kinds of models created on basis of the dataset of the [iNaturalist 2021 Comptetition](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_comp/tree/master/2021). The code was extracted from this [repository](https://github.com/deblagoj/iNaturalist-API) by [deblagoj](https://github.com/deblagoj) as a contribution to the iNaturalist 2017 Competition.

## How-To

1. (recommended but not absolutely necessary) create and activate own (conda) environment 
2. install packages 
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision 
   ```
3. Clone this repository 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EibSReM/iNaturalist_Competition.git
   ``` 
   and change to respective directory
5. Download pretrained models from the paper [here](https://cornell.box.com/s/bnyhq5lwobu6fgjrub44zle0pyjijbmw), mentioned in the [papers repository](https://github.com/visipedia/newt/tree/main/benchmark).
6. Adapt path to pytorch model and images (folder) in the `inference.py` script. We used the model in: `cvpr21_newt_pretrained_models\cvpr21_newt_pretrained_models\pt\inat2021_supervised_large_from_scratch.pth.tar`. Image data we used is available upon request.
7. Run script 
   ```
   python inference.py
   ```
8. Find results in `Output.txt`
